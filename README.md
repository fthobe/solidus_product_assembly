Create a product which is composed of other products.

## Installation

Add solidus_product_assembly to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_product_assembly'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bin/rails generate solidus_product_assembly:install
```

## Usage

To build a bundle (assembly product) you'd need to first check the "Can be part"
flag on each product you want to be part of the bundle. Then create a product
and add parts to it. By doing that you're making that product an assembly.

The store will treat assemblies a bit different than regular products on checkout.
Solidus will create and track inventory units for its parts rather than for the product itself.
That means you essentially have a product composed of other products. From a
customer perspective it's like they are paying a single amount for a collection
of products.

## Development

### Testing the extension

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy
app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using
`bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your `spec/spec_helper.rb`:

```ruby
require 'solidus_product_assembly/testing_support/factories'
```

Or, if you are using `FactoryBot.definition_file_paths`, you can load Solidus core
factories along with this extension's factories using this statement:

```ruby
SolidusDevSupport::TestingSupport::Factories.load_for(SolidusProductAssembly::Engine)
```

### Running the sandbox

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application, you can run `bin/sandbox`. The path for
the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails commands to
`sandbox/bin/rails`.

Here's an example:

```
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

### Updating the changelog

Before and after releases the changelog should be updated to reflect the up-to-date status of
the project:

```shell
bin/rake changelog
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Update the changelog"
```
